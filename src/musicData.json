Even more sample-heavy than a usual College Hill release, these tracks prominently sample other dubstep and dance music producers in a way that would be transgressive when viewed as a traditional bass music release. As such, these tracks were produced from a crate digging hip-hop perspective, a outsider's. Free download. Track 10 is a partial remake of the instrumental to 21 Savage - Bank Account.",
