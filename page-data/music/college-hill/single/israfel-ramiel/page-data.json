Originally conceived as part of a massive Neon Genesis Evangelion-themed bass music double album, these seven minute epics were produced in 2014 at the peak of the new wave grime / deconstructed club movements. Heavily distorted bass, tribal percussion, and extended weightless sections feature prominently in both tracks alongside College Hill's signature melodic sensibilities."},"alias":"college-hill","artistName":"College Hill"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
