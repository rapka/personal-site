The VIP starts off similar to the original mix before abruptly dropping the tempo back down into dubstep territory. The 'sub. text. mix.' on the other hand goes weightless and almost completely drops the drums, letting the deep bassline fully take over."},"alias":"college-hill","artistName":"College Hill"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
