Even more sample-heavy than your average College Hill release, these tracks prominently sample other dubstep and dance music producers in a way that would be transgressive when viewed as a traditional bass music album. As such, this music was produced from the perspective of a crate digging hip-hop producer unfamiliar with the scene. Free download. Track 10 is a partial remake of 21 Savage - Bank Account. Mastered by Subsequent.","bandcampId":"3658324833","bandcampOptions":{"size":"large"}},"alias":"college-hill","artistName":"College Hill"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
