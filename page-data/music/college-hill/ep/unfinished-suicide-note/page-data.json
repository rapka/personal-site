These distorted, experimental beats date back to the sessions that led to the 2016 \"Murder-Suicide\" EP on Slit Jockey Records. Re-edited and remastered in 2022, these bass-heavy, minimal tunes are some of the most challenging tracks in the College Hill catalog. The first two tracks take the lo-fi concept to an extreme, occasionally descending into pure noise while the latter tracks blend grime and dubstep with elements of alternative and punk rock."},"alias":"college-hill","artistName":"College Hill"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
